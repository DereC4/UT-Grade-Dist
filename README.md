The backbone of the website ^^

When I was making my [UT Grade Distribution website](https://derec4.github.io/ut-grade-distribution-viewer/), I needed a more reliable source for the grade data. As a result, I scraped the publicly available mess of grade distribution data and compiled it into this data store for everyone to use!
